# Conway's Game of Life 🎮

Watch tiny cells come alive, multiply, and die in this mesmerizing cellular automaton! 🧬

In Conway's Game of Life, simple rules create complex patterns:
- **Survive**: Cells with 2-3 neighbors live on
- **Die**: Lonely cells (<2 neighbors) or overcrowded cells (>3 neighbors) perish
- **Born**: Empty spaces with exactly 3 neighbors spring to life!

This project is a fun playground for learning **test-driven development** (TDD) while building one of computer science's most elegant simulations.
